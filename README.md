# driver-drowsiness-detection

# Project Description: 
It’s a sleepy driver Alarm.
We often hear about people fall asleep while driving, and this is a serious issue that leads to many people’s death. Our project targets this kind of accidents through the sleepy driver Alarm.

# Idea: 
keep tracking of the driver through face and eye detection, notice any unusual thing like his eyes’ closing. If he closes his eyes for more than 2 seconds then the alarm starts at once. 
The 2 seconds allowance is for the precautions if the driver is blinking.

# Project Implementation Plan: 
-Camera setup in front of the driver.
-Alarm setup in the car.
-Face detection -specifically Eye detection- implementation. 
(In our project the implementation is all on a mobile application with the mobile camera and mobile alarm)

# Team members’ roles:
-Eye detection implementation.
-Detecting if the eye closes for more than 2 seconds.
-Accessing the Alarm in case of danger.
-handling special cases like if the driver is out of the camera scope by warning.
